Day Planner
=====================

This is a planner for those of us that work 8am-5pm. 
There are time blocks throughout the day that will change colour as the day goes on, highlighting to you if the time has passed, if we're currently in it or it's upcoming.
As you input your day-to-day tasks these will be stored and you will be able to come back throughout the day and still be able to see your tasks.
